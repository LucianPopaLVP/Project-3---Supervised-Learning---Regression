    "Air pollution will endanger human health and life in big cities, especially to the elderly and children. This is not an individual  problem of one person but a global problem. Therefore, many countries  in the world made air pollution monitoring and control stations in many cities to observe air pollutants such as NO2, CO, SO2, PM2.5, and PM10 to alert the citizens about pollution index which exceeds the quality threshold. \n",

    "Particulate Matter PM 2.5 is a fine atmospheric pollutant that has a diameter of fewer than 2.5 micrometers. Particulate Matter PM10 is a coarse particulate that is 10  micrometers or less in diameter. Carbon Monoxide CO is a product of combustion of fuel such as coal, wood, or natural gas. Vehicular  emission contributes to the majority of carbon  monoxide  let into  our atmosphere. Nitrogen dioxide or nitrogen oxide expelled from high-temperature combustion: sulfur dioxide SO2 and Sulphur Oxides SO produced by volcanoes and in industrial processes. Petroleum and Coal often contain sulfur compounds, and their combustion generates sulfur dioxide. Air pollution is caused by the presence of poison gases and substances; therefore, it is impacted by the meteorological factors of a particular place, such as temperature, humidity, rain, and wind.\n",
