    "This is the dataset is a modified version of the California Housing Data used in the paper Pace, R. Kelley, and Ronald Barry. \"Sparse spatial autoregressions.\" Statistics & Probability Letters 33.3 (1997): 291-297.. It serves as an excellent introduction to implementing machine learning algorithms because it requires rudimentary data cleaning, has an easily understandable list of variables and sits at an optimal size between being too toyish and too cumbersome.\n",
