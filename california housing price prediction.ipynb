    "This is the dataset is a modified version of the California Housing Data used in the paper Pace, R. Kelley, and Ronald Barry. \"Sparse spatial autoregressions.\" Statistics & Probability Letters 33.3 (1997): 291-297.. It serves as an excellent introduction to implementing machine learning algorithms because it requires rudimentary data cleaning, has an easily understandable list of variables and sits at an optimal size between being too toyish and too cumbersome.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data contains information from the 1990 California census. So although it may not help you with predicting current housing prices like the Zillow Zestimate dataset, it does provide an accessible introductory dataset for teaching people about the basics of machine learning."
