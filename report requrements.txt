Required
Once you have selected a data set, you will produce the deliverables listed below and submit them to one of your peers for review. Treat this exercise as an opportunity to produce analysis that are ready to highlight your analytical skills for a senior audience, for example, the Chief Data Officer, or the Head of Analytics at your company.

Sections required in your report:

Main objective of the analysis that specifies whether your model will be focused on prediction or interpretation. 
Brief description of the data set you chose and a summary of its attributes. 
Brief summary of data exploration and actions taken for data cleaning and feature engineering. 
Summary of training at least three linear regression models which should be variations that cover using a simple linear regression as a baseline, adding polynomial effects, and using a regularization regression. Preferably, all use the same training and test splits, or the same cross-validation method. 
A paragraph explaining which of your regressions you recommend as a final model that best fits your needs in terms of accuracy and explainability. 
Summary Key Findings and Insights, which walks your reader through the main drivers of your model and insights from your data derived from your linear regression model. 
Suggestions for next steps in analyzing this data, which may include suggesting revisiting this model adding specific data features to achieve a better explanation or a better prediction.
