One of the main objectives of this course is to help you gain hands-on experience in communicating insightful and impactful findings to stakeholders. In this project you will use the tools and techniques you learned throughout this course to train a few linear regressions on a data set that you feel passionate about, select the regression that best suits your needs, and communicate insights you found from your modeling exercise.

After going through some guided steps, you will have insights that either explain or predict your outcome variable. As a main deliverable, you will submit a report that helps you focus on highlighting your analytical skills and thought process.

Write your report from the perspective of a Chief Data Officer or the Head of Analytics that will assess whether your final linear regression went through all the necessary steps to achieve the main objective of your analysis.

This report is intended as a summary of your findings, not as a code review. Optionally, you can submit your code as a python notebook or as a print out in the appendix of your document.

The grading will center around 5 main points:

Does the report include a section describing the data?
Does the report include a paragraph detailing the main objective(s) of this analysis?
Does the report include a section with variations of linear regression models and specifies which one is the model that best suits the main objective(s) of this analysis.
Does the report include a clear and well presented section with key findings related to the main objective(s) of the analysis?
Does the report highlight possible flaws in the model and a plan of action to revisit this analysis with additional data or different predictive modeling techniques?
